# Decision: portfolio outbox and portfolio draft should be separated modules

Before decision was made I was having only outbox module. It is responsible
for storing portfolios we would like to check. But having only single module
makes that we are sending newly requested portfolio every single time to kafka.

We can have situation that user for example defines portfolio that consists of 
Amazon and Apple. But these are well known companies and we already know these 
tickers exists (as we are storing existing ones in application). So then there is 
no need to send it to kafka. 

So this is why new module draft has appeared - it is a place when we are making decision
if the stocks from portfolio exists (so we can just create portfolio from it) or we do not know
(so we put it into further processing to outbox module) and then sending it to Stock Data Service (python one).
