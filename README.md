## Project wallet
Project walled is a web tool, that is still in very early devlopment phase (may have bugs). 
As it evolved from POC it's missing tests for now (I focused mostly on useful capabilities). 

Currently what project wallet can help you in:

1. Defining your wallet (by providing tickers of companies you have) and tracking it's value.

For now everything is displayed as PLN (but more currencies will be supported in future). You can also view some live tracking, just like shown below (chart is flat, by the time of making screenshot market was closed).
Still need to work on aliging texts on FE (some unconsistencies between PL and ENG language).

2. Geographical distribution of investments.

In existing tools on market I'm missing some clear dashboards of investments distribution. In project wallet you can check it easily. Just like on screen below:

3. Sector distribution of investments.

Simple calculation of sector distribution:

## Plans
I've got lot of ideas of how to develop this application. Some of them are mentioned in issues section on github.

## Additional information
Application is still in **very** early phase of development - it may contain bugs.
